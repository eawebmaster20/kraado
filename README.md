## Architecture Overview

This service manages bookings for solo service providers, integrating several components:

- **REST API**: Exposes endpoints for clients to create and view bookings.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores bookings and user data using TypeORM.
- **Redis**: Handles asynchronous jobs (e.g., notifications, reminders) via Bull queues.
- **WebSocket**: Sends real-time notifications to clients about booking status updates.
- **gRPC**: Provides an internal API for other backend services to interact with bookings.
- **Rate-limiting**: Protects REST endpoints from abuse using NestJS Throttler.
- **Authentication**: Secures endpoints using JWT-based authentication.

### Component Connections

- Clients interact with the service via REST endpoints and receive real-time updates through WebSocket connections.
- The service persists all booking data in a PostgreSQL database.
- When a booking is created or updated, asynchronous jobs (such as sending notifications) are queued in Redis using Bull.
- Internal services can access booking data and operations through a gRPC interface.
- All REST endpoints are protected by rate-limiting and require authentication via JWT tokens.

**Flow Example:**
1. A client sends a booking request to the REST API (with a JWT token).
2. The service authenticates the request and checks rate limits.
3. The booking is saved to PostgreSQL.
4. A notification job is queued in Redis.
5. The client receives a real-time update via WebSocket.
6. Internal services can query or update bookings using gRPC.
